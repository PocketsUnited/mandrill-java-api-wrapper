It provides a builder style syntax to create requests for the various endpoints. It offers service class implementations that can have some default values e.g. for your Mandrill API key. It is ready to be used within a Spring application\r\n\r\n### Status\r\nCurrently only a subset of the API endpoints is covered. A full coverage is planned for the 1.0.0 release\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n- Michael Duergner (@duergner)\r\n- @ursshl\r\n- @theMatthias\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nContact Michael Duergner easiest way on Twitter: https://twitter.com/duergner\r\n","google":"UA-48511636-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
